Day 1

Documentation says "import IO" or "use IO", but former gives:

day1.chpl:1: In module 'day1':
day1.chpl:3: error: 'iomode' undeclared (first use this function)

Code snippets on https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/IO.html should include use/import
statement.

Day 3

Why can a class reference itself but a record cannot? Need better documentation of this either
yay or nay, esp. in the record primer. Seems like such a thing would be popular. 

(key, value) = buffer.split(':') would be useful.
